Hey visitor,

My name is Tony. I'm a full stack software engineer. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Indiana University - Bloomington. I took Professor Dahkilic's Intro to CS course on a whim and completely fell in love with programming -- to the point of dropping out of business school with just a year to finish. I have worked as a full stack software engineer at a YCombinator backed B2B SaaS Fintech called Modernbanc (W20). I am a true generalist, meaning I have a broad range of experience in both technical and non-technical fields.

On the technical side I love doing everything across the stack. I prefer open-source and self-hosted solutions whenever possible. I believe it makes you a better engineer and is more sustainable for any business long-term to minimize costs. On the non-technical side I have worked in operations, finance, sales, and marketing. I am comfortable networking, talking to users, going to events, negotiating deals, etc. 

In terms of team environment there are a few things I look for. I prefer a democratic decision-making environment where we foster buy-in, psychological safety, and data driven decision making. I want to make sure everyone on my team feels they have a voice, feels heard, and is comfortable speaking freely. I believe this is critical to motivation, creativity, and productivity. Things like design sprints, yes-and framework, and a celebration of failed ideas are a few ways to cultivate this environment.

note to potential employers: i recently deleted a bunch of major repositories because I was moving them and it got rid of my entire commit history for them. oops. i love to code, I pinky promise. if it makes you feel better I can hack the commit history to make it look like whatever you want it to look like
